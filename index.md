## Welcome to Project Leek Investment Analysis Revolution

This is a study-purpose project started by two rookies who are looking for a way to have a better understanding about investing and mechines learning. Quantitative Investment would probably be a good choice for us, so se decide to start this new project, for getting some real practice on how the combination of financing theories and mechine learning helps people make good decisions in capital market.

We dont' know how long would this project take us to finish, or even may not be finished, but we are still working on it and enjoying the progression we have done so far!

### Introduction

The word 'Leek' is a meme in Chinese capital market and has the similar meaning of 'Sheep' in capital market.

We are developing four major modules for our project, as the name shows, they are:

- **Leek**: a decision making module, which contains all the investment logic inside and make the buy/sell desicion
- **Investment**: a module that does the back test to give a result of all the activities
- **Analysis**: a module that gives us a report of all the invevstment and grades the performance
- **Revolusion**: a module that using couple technics to enchance the investment logic in 'Leek' module

The world 'LIAR' itself is the realization of quantitative investment from us. I do believe that a success investment contains 3 steps:

1. Turn cash into capital
2. Wait until capital grows up
3. Turn capital back to cash

Since cash won't increase by itself, people have to turn them into a state which would grow up through time, and get them back to more cash to actually realize the gain in cash. Quantitative investment earns the money from pricing error in the capital market, it's a typical zero-sum game and won't enchance the groth or economics, so we take quantitative investment as a 'fake' investment, so called 'LIAR'.
